          <p class="para5">The Bible say ‚Äú the entrance of the word giveth light; and understanding unto the simple‚Äù. My self esteem has been rebuilt to the glory of God and I have gained more confidence to step out and get who God wants me to be. At IBOR I learnt that true beauty or becoming a real woman emanates by having true intimacy with Jesus. Now I can strike a balance between inner beauties and outward beauties. I really want to thank God for having a life changing encounter with the visioneer of IBOR who is an exceptional woman of God and teacher of the word, my mentor and mother Pastor Nike Owolabi who accepted the Call of God.

          <p class="para5">When I met Ibor some years back, it was at the beginning of a new phase of my life. I learned to be confident for the new me I was becoming, and also how to be bold in the face if the new stages I would be going through in this new season. My eyes were open to caring for others and the joys of the secret place. My focus changed and aligned me to a greater purpose

          <p class="para5">It was in the year 2018 I attended IBOR at federal palace hotel. As I made entrance into the Hall, the Holy ghost spoke to me clearly that I would receive direction that night and I certainly received it!!!! Proceeding the evening, I had asked God what next understand my journey of purpose driven life after obtaining my LLB Lowüòä. As the event was unfolded that night, it was time for the panelists session and as they were introducing themselves, naturally I was drawn to the only lawyer among them - Mrs Any Sadare and when it was her turn to speak, she spoke my mind on marriage counseling and I figure out that she was the answer to that ‚Äúwhat next`` question.
